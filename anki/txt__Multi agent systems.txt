What is ubiquity?	The reduced cost of processing power leads to a rise in the artefacts in which a processor has been placed
What is interconnection?	The increase of connections between computers, and the increasing amount of data that is sent and received
What is intelligence?	The tasks that we solve using computers are becoming more and more complex
What is human orientation?	We relate to computers / machinery in a more human like fashion, increasingly reflecting the world around us.
What is intentional systems?	Entities whose behaviours can be predicted by the method of attributing belief, desires, and rational acumen.
What is a first order statement?	"A belief:<div>""Craig thinks that spaghetti is an acceptable breakfast food""</div>"
"""I think my friend believes in magic"" - is this first order?"	The second half is first order, but a belief about a belief is a second order statement
What is a second order statement?	We have a belief, about a belief.
WHy do we want an intentional system?	Gives us a non technical way to understand and explain agents.
What is a post-declarative system?	If we have beliefs and desires, the system can bring around the desires into reality.
"What degree of intentional system is this?<div>""Clive thinks that Anna knows he suspects Anna was stealing from the office biscuit fund""</div>"	3rd degree

What is Tau in behaviour of environment?	T for transform
t(e0 -&gt; e1, e1 -&gt; e2) = {e3, e4}<div>Is this deterministic?</div>	No, its non deterministic as we do not know the outcome.
T(r) = empty set, what is this?	Game over, because the agent is stuck. Can't do anything to get out from where it is.
If for every single action the transformer function returns 1, is this non deterministic?	No, it is deterministic&nbsp;
If for all runs apart from 1, the state transformer function returns 1 but it returns {1, 0} for 1 run, is it still deterministic?	No, it is non deterministic even for 1 run. Because we can't guarantee what the effect fo each and every action is going to be.
What is a purely reactive agent?	Don't care about the past, only the future.&nbsp;<div>They only map a state to an action, always do the same thing in the same state.</div>
