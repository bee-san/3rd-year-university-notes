Issues of cross validation include:<div>*&nbsp;<span class=cloze>[...]</span></div><div>*&nbsp;If we are setting hyper paraemters the best paraemters might be in a different fold</div>	Issues of cross validation include:<div>*&nbsp;<span class=cloze>Slow</span></div><div>*&nbsp;If we are setting hyper paraemters the best paraemters might be in a different fold</div><br>

How naive is naive bayes?	Sometimes too naive. The probability of Liverpool winning a football match is not independent of the probability for each member of the team scoring a goal.&nbsp;
What is Laplace smoothing?	We can borrow some probabilities from high probability features and distribute them among zero probability features
We can borrow some probabilities from high probability features and distribute them among zero probability features	What is Laplace smoothing?
Let count(cat) = 9, count(dog) = 0,  count(rabbit) = 1. Compute P(cat), P(dog), P(rabbit)	\[P(cat) = (9)/(9 + 0 + 1) = 0.9\] \[p(dog)=0/9+0+1 = 0\] \[p(rabbit) = 1/9+0+1 = 0.1\]

What is a bag of words?	"We turn the words into a vector where element corresponds to total frequency in document. {""Burger"": 2} ""Burger Burger"""
What is multinomial distribution?	Extension of binomial distribution for more than 2 classes
What is a rule based classifier?	Learn a rule from training data in the form IF x THEN y<div><br></div><div>IF forecast = rainy THEN play=NO</div>

When designing rules, do we want them to be complicated?	No! Occam's Razor
Why is Occam's razor best?	If we have lots of rules it is likely to overfit
